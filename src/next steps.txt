Info: Folder structure = hydrophone -> year -> month
Naming convention: ISO HydrophoneName_YYYY-MM-DD.parquet


Next steps:

Add top-level to pipeline: single function that will generate a range of files - Grant
Add parameters to top-level of pipeline to control time and hz frequency - Mitch
Add ambient noise to the fft - Mitch
Add rollup step to combine timeframes into desired granularity - Grant
Process to generate/select correct folder and file and name file with timestamp - Caleb
Function to read files by hydrophone and date-range, specify pds or broadband - Caleb

Generate some files to determine best granularity/size of parquet files - All/When we're ready

Questions for next meeting:

Final decision on granularity
Should we add broadband column to pds parquet files
